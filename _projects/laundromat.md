We at hackartscience love film and TV, but are not very fond of carrying our obscure collections around with us.
We do, however, usually have access to the internet.
We pooled and curated our movie collections, and hosted the resulting rare media wonderland Ã  la [Netflix][netflix] via a web application with some strong security guarantees.
Laundromat is hosted on a tiny [Raspberry Pi][raspberrypi], and is surprisingly capable of streaming high-bandwidth video to a handful of users concurrently.
