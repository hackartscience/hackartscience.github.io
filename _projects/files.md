We host a private cloud (powered by [ownCloud][owncloud]), and use it to manage the web-facing resources used by all of our websites.
This makes our [GitHub Pages][githubpages] cost-free hosting solution a very capable one indeed: resources that do not belong in a repository are managed by this very convenient CMS.
It's also our own private encrypted [Dropbox][dropbox]!
