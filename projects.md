> Reserving rooms at [Mannes New School](http://www.newschool.edu/mannes/) is annoying, especially if you are hoping to establish a regular schedule. Do you want this process automated? This little app does just that: given a weekly schedule, it reserves your preferred rooms in a timely manner. Let us know if you would like your practice room reservations automated!

> Sailboats are often seen as a lavish status symbol, but we believe sailing is within reach of any motivated group or individual.
> We started a sailing co-op of our own with our adorable little sailboat, "Leah's Heritage", a 26-foot semi-custom [O'Day Outlaw](http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=436) (designed by [Philip Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Rhodes)), a capable heavy displacement cruising sloop.
> We take care to detail our maintenance and improvement projects, our trips, and our expenses as a free and open resource to DIY sailors everywhere.
> Chief among these projects is a custom navigation system, which ties [NMEA2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_2000) components into a DIY chartplotter and ship computer.
> We also undertook an extensive rebuild of the ship's rudder and bulkheads, refitting the mast, and updated the sail inventory, and carefully documented our work.
>Read about our adventures, and come sailing with us!

> We host a private cloud (powered by [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/)), and use it to manage the web-facing resources used by all of our websites.
> This makes our [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) cost-free hosting solution a very capable one indeed: resources that do not belong in a repository are managed by this very convenient CMS.
> It's our own private [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)!

> We at hackartscience love film and TV, but are not very fond of carrying our obscure collections around with us.
> We do, however, usually have access to the internet.
> We pooled and curated our movie collections, and hosted the resulting rare media wonderland Ã  la [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/browse) via a web application with some strong security guarantees.
> Laundromat is hosted on a tiny [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), and is surprisingly capable of streaming high-bandwidth video to a handful of users concurrently.
