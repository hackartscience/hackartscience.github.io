> Reserving rooms at [Mannes New School](http://www.newschool.edu/mannes/) is annoying, especially if you are hoping to establish a regular schedule. Do you want this process automated? This little app does just that: given a weekly schedule, it reserves your preferred rooms in a timely manner. Let us know if you would like your practice room reservations automated!
